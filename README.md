# Face Mesh Detection with OpenCV and Mediapipe

This project uses OpenCV and Mediapipe to perform real-time face mesh detection on a video file. The face mesh provides a high-precision face landmark detection that is useful for various computer vision tasks, such as face recognition, facial expression analysis, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenCV 4.5.1 or later
- Mediapipe 0.8.3 or later

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ImtiazAhammad/Face-Landmark-using-Mediapipe.git
   cd face-mesh-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
   ```

## Usage

1. **Place your video file in the project directory** and rename it to `3.mp4` or update the script to use the desired file name.

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python face_mesh_detection.py
   ```

3. **Watch the output video** with face mesh detection applied in real-time. The FPS (frames per second) is also displayed on the video.
